		<p>These are called <em>narcissus</em>. I bought the bulb in a floral shop named Dilly Lily in the City of Chicago. After taking it back home, I grew the bulb in water. Narcissus flowers blossom in the middle of winter. This photo was taken Jan 26, 2015. They were so aromatic as if I could smell the scent today. </p>
